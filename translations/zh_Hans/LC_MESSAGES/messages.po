"**Infrastructure**: corresponds to the hosting of the tools used by the "
"project, such as the website, documentation, forum, technical tools, etc. "
"The amount of this expenditure should reduce in 2025 following a migration "
"to a dedicated server from a friendly host provider."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Events**: expenses to enable the team to attend events (e.g. [JdLL]"
"(https://jdll.org/)) and to meet in the same place once a year to work "
"together on fundamental issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Collective facilitation**: financial compensation allocated to the tasks "
"of administrative facilitation, animation and coordination of the "
"collective. This is a new type of expense introduced in 2025, decided by the "
"collective given the need to have a person dedicated to these aspects (a.k.a "
"“stirrer”)."
